Escape Room Challenge

Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges, including:

Handling asynchronous operations: I had to ensure that the application handled asynchronous operations correctly, particularly when fetching data from external files and simulating delays in the navigateLabyrinth function.
Manipulating and comparing dates: I had to adjust the findMostRecentBook function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.
Determining the intersection of two sets: I had to fix the findIntersection function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.
Handling user interactions: I had to ensure that the application responded correctly to user interactions, such as clicking buttons and displaying results.

Improvements

While the application is functional, there are several areas for improvement, including:

Error handling: The application currently lacks proper error handling, which could be added to improve the user experience.
Accessibility: The application could be made more accessible by adding ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility features.
Styling: The application's styling is basic and could be improved with additional CSS or a CSS framework.
Testing: The application could be tested more thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly in different browsers and on different devices.

What I Learned

During the development of this project, I learned about various JavaScript concepts, including:

Asynchronous operations: I learned how to handle asynchronous operations using promises and the async/await syntax.
Manipulating and comparing dates: I learned how to manipulate and compare dates using JavaScript's Date object.
Determining the intersection of two sets: I learned how to determine the intersection of two sets using the Set object.
Handling user interactions: I learned how to handle user interactions using JavaScript's addEventListener method.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Escape Room Challenge was a fun and educational project that allowed me to practice various JavaScript concepts. Through this project, I was able to improve my skills in handling asynchronous operations, manipulating and comparing dates, determining the intersection of two sets, and handling user interactions. While there are areas for improvement, the project serves as a solid foundation for further learning and development.
